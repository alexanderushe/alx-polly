# üó≥Ô∏è ALX-Polly: Email Notification System Integration

## üîñ Project Title & Description

**ALX-Polly Enhanced Notification System** is an extension of the existing real-time polling application that integrates comprehensive email notification functionality. This system will automatically notify users about critical poll events, ensuring higher engagement and participation rates.

### What We're Building
An intelligent email notification system that seamlessly integrates with the existing ALX-Polly application to provide:
- **Poll Closing Alerts**: Automated notifications when polls are about to close or have closed
- **New Poll Notifications**: Alerts when new polls are created in categories users follow
- **Voting Reminders**: Gentle reminders for users who haven't voted on active polls
- **Results Announcements**: Notifications when poll results are available
- **Admin Notifications**: Special alerts for poll creators about engagement metrics

### Who It's For
- **Poll Participants**: Users who want to stay informed about poll activities without constantly checking the app
- **Poll Creators**: Administrators and content creators who need engagement insights and poll lifecycle management
- **Organizations**: Teams and communities using polls for decision-making who need reliable notification systems

### Why It Matters
- **Increased Engagement**: Proactive notifications drive higher participation rates
- **Better User Experience**: Users never miss important polls or results
- **Accessibility**: Email notifications make the platform accessible to users with different usage patterns
- **Analytics & Insights**: Notification tracking provides valuable engagement metrics
- **Professional Reliability**: Enterprise-grade notification system for serious polling applications

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4+ with shadcn/ui components

### Email & Notification Infrastructure
- **Email Service**: Resend.com (modern email API with excellent deliverability)

- **Queue System**: Supabase Edge Functions with scheduled triggers
- **Background Jobs**: Supabase Cron for time-based notifications
- **Real-time Updates**: Supabase Realtime for immediate notification triggers

### Development & Deployment Tools
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky for pre-commit hooks
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode with Zod for runtime validation
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright for E2E
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automatic previews
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics + Supabase Dashboard

### Additional Libraries
- **Email Validation**: `validator.js` for robust email validation
- **Date Handling**: `date-fns` for poll scheduling and notification timing
- **Logging**: `pino` for structured logging
- **Environment Management**: `dotenv` with validation schemas

## üß† AI Integration Strategy

### Code Generation & Testing
- **IDE Integration**: Cursor for context-aware code generation
- **Scaffolding**: AI generates components, API routes, database migrations, and utility functions
- **Testing Support**: AI-assisted unit, integration, and E2E tests with Jest and Playwright
- **Schema Awareness**: Generates TypeScript interfaces and migrations matching the Supabase schema

### Documentation Strategy
- Automated API, component, and email template documentation
- Configuration guides and usage examples generated by AI

## Project Features & Scheduled Polls

- **User Authentication:** Supabase Auth for registration and login
- **Protected Routes:** Accessible only to authenticated users
- **Poll Creation & Voting:** Users can create polls, vote, and see results
- **Scheduled Polls:** Set start and end times for polls
- **Edit & Delete Polls:** Only poll creators can modify or remove polls
- **My Votes:** Track polls voted on

## Security Audit and Remediation

### 1. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Issue:** `updatePoll` and `deletePoll` allowed any user to modify/delete polls.
- **Fix:** Now checks that `creator_id` matches the authenticated user.

### 2. Missing Authentication
- **Issue:** `app/api/items/route.ts` had no auth checks.
- **Fix:** Added `getCurrentUser` verification to GET and POST handlers.

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Issue:** `name` and `description` fields could inject scripts.
- **Fix:** Sanitized HTML characters before storing in the database.

## Database Queries
